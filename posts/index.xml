      <description>Attending My First Hackathon: FOSS Hack 2024 in Bangalore. Recently, I attended my first hackathon, “FOSSHack,” in Bangalore. My two friends and I decided to participate in this hackathon about 2–3 months ago, but we hadn’t decided what we were going to build. When only one month remained until the hackathon, we finally decided to make an app for Linux that would provide backgrounds for images or screenshots, either gradient or solid colors.</description>

      <description>Organizing my first tech FOSS Meetup This is my first general blog in which I will be sharing my experience organizing the first meet-up of SolapurFOSS. After the SolapurFOSS Conference SolapurFOSS is actually handled by my friend Mangesh, and under his lead, we conducted our first FOSS conference in Solapur on 27th August 2023. Later, after successfully organizing the SolapurFOSS conference, the three of us ( Me, Mangesh, and Jacob ) were deciding on conducting a Linux installation workshop.</description>
