<p>This is my first general blog in which
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yash-m-81371624a/">I</a> will be sharing my
experience organizing the first meet-up of SolapurFOSS.

<h1 id="after-the-solapurfoss-conference">After the SolapurFOSS Conference</h1>
<p>SolapurFOSS is actually handled by my friend
<a href="https://mangesh.xyz">Mangesh</a>, and under his lead, we conducted our
first FOSS conference in Solapur on 27th August 2023. Later, after
successfully organizing the SolapurFOSS conference, the three of us (
<a href="https://github.com/YashReddy1963">Me</a>, Mangesh,
and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-salvi">Jacob</a> ) were deciding on
conducting a Linux installation workshop. Mangesh had good knowledge about Linux, but
Jacob and I were terrible at
it. We didn&rsquo;t even know how Linux works, how to install it, what a
kernel is, what a shell is, or how to install various things just by
writing a one-line command. So, we decided to first understand all these
things and then share our knowledge with others. At the same time (as we
were in our last year of diploma), we had to create a final year
project. Managing all this stuff was really difficult; we used to read
about Linux, try to create our final year project, and then had to give
our semester exams. While this was going on, Mangesh took permission to
leave college for a whole semester for his internship, and because of
all this, we didn&rsquo;t organize the workshop.</p>
<h1 id="conducting-session">Conducting Session</h1>
<p>So, after 6 months, we decided to take a session for junior students of
our college, covering what Linux is, what FOSS is, etc. This helped
students get an idea about FOSS, and many of them were interested in
learning more about it. One girl, Akshara, reached out to us; she was
curious and wanted to be a part of SolapurFOSS. We included her in our
team, and now she handles our social media platforms. Now, the scenario
was that our organizer got busy with his office stuff,
Mangesh had to manage his office work and some
FOSS community work, so he didn&rsquo;t get time to look after the SolapurFOSS
community. At this moment, Mangesh passed the
leadership to Me and
Aabha for conducting meet-ups or
sessions so that our community would still remain alive.
Jacob used to create the
designs of posters and social media posts for our community.</p>
<h1 id="meet-up-planning">Meet-up Planning</h1>
<p>In the last week of February, we, the team members, decided to conduct a
meet-up in March. We decided to conduct the meet-up at Mangesh&rsquo;s house
because we didn&rsquo;t expect that many people would come. For the meet-up,
our first speaker was <a href="https://wisharya.com/">Vishal Aarya</a>. Vishal was
busy with his work and was unable to give an offline talk, so we decided
to keep it virtual. Next, we managed two speakers who were our
volunteers, Mangesh and
Aabha. Mangesh&rsquo;s topic was &lsquo;What
is an Engineer&rsquo;, and Aabha was
giving a talk on her project &lsquo;An agricultural bot for smart farming&rsquo;.
Then we reached out to one of our senior college students, Roni, to
propose a talk for our meet-up, and he said yes. So, the date was fixed,
the place was fixed, and we were good to go. As we were just left with 3
days for our meet-up, we got 38 registrations. Because of this, we
decided to change the place and booked our college conference hall.</p>
<h1 id="the-meet-up-day">The Meet-up Day</h1>
<p>We were left with 3 speakers; Roni had to cancel his talk due to some
traveling issues. We wanted to start the meet-up at 10:30, but there was
just one guy present for the meet-up, lol. We waited until 11:30, and a
few students came. Also, one of our staff members asked our college
students if they wanted to attend the meet-up, and they were interested.
So, in this way, there were around 20 students present at the meetup. We
began with Aabha talk and then
moved to Vishal&rsquo;s. Again,we made a last moment change, The virtual talk
by Vishal Aarya was not conducted as he was
moving for some other event. Lastly, Mangesh gave
his talk and ended the meet-up. We found that there were more female
attending the meet-up; only 3 male were present.</p>
<h1 id="next-plan">Next Plan</h1>
<p>We are planning for another meet-up in May. When we asked students if
they liked the meet-up and if they wanted to attend such meet-ups in the
future, many of them were interested. Also, Vishal said that he will give an offline talk in
the upcoming meet-up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how our meet-up ended, and yes, it was fun managing all this
stuff as an organizer. Also, as this was my first non-tech blog,
I just wrote whatever
came to mind. If you find something that I should improve on, please
feel free to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yash-m-81371624a/">DM</a> me.</p>
