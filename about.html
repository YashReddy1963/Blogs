        <div class="about">
            As a 17-year-old technology and programming enthusiast from Maharashtra, I am currently expanding my skillset in front-end development. 
            In addition to having a solid foundation in languages such as C/C++, I have also completed a project in the language.
            <br> <br>
            My interests extend beyond programming, as I enjoy writing about current technologies, AI, IoT, and other related topics through my blog. 
            I also have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrMUyW121WDiP4fZOWH6BDQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a> channel where I share my knowledge and insights on various technology-related topics. 
            <br> <br>
            In my free time, I engage in hobbies such as photography, graphic design, and video editing. 
            Additionally, I am an avid reader and have recently read "Think Like A Monk" by Jay Sheety and am currently reading "Ikigai" by Hector Garcia and Francesc Miralles.
