    <div class="about">
        As a 17-year-old technology and programming enthusiast from Maharashtra, I am currently expanding my skillset in
        front-end development.
        In addition to having a solid foundation in languages such as C/C++, I have also completed a project in the
        language.
        <br> <br>
        My interests extend beyond programming, as I enjoy writing about current technologies, AI, IoT, and other
        related topics through my blog.
        
        <br> <br>
        In my free time, I engage in hobbies such as photography, graphic design, and video editing.
        Additionally, I am an avid reader and have recently read "Think Like A Monk" by Jay Sheety and am currently
        reading "Ikigai" by Hector Garcia and Francesc Miralles.
