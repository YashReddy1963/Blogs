      <description>Organizing my first tech FOSS Meetup This is my first general blog in which I will be sharing my experience organizing the first meet-up of SolapurFOSS. After the SolapurFOSS Conference SolapurFOSS is actually handled by my friend Mangesh, and under his lead, we conducted our first FOSS conference in Solapur on 27th August 2023. Later, after successfully organizing the SolapurFOSS conference, the three of us ( Me, Mangesh, and Jacob ) were deciding on conducting a Linux installation workshop.</description>
